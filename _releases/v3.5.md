# v3.5.0 *2019-10-01*

## Editor

- [#1958](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1958)/[#1959](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1959): Code completion will no longer include duplicates when the same item is imported via multiple libraries.
- [#1988](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1988): Saving a `pubspec.yaml` file that appears in the Explorer tree multiple times (due to overlapping multi-root workspaces) will now automatically run `pub get` instead of prompting as if it needs running for multiple projects.
- [#1973](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1973): `pub get` will no longer run automatically when `pubspec.yaml` files are modified inside a `.dart_tool` folder.
- [#1972](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1972): Prompts to run `pub get` are now disabled when working in the Dart SDK repository.
- [#1981](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1981)/[#2022](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2022): File extensions in the `dart.additionalAnalyzerFileExtensions` settings are now registered for additional editor functionality, such as Outline and Folding. This will allow analysis server plugins to provide additional functionality for non-Dart files.
- [#2007](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2007): The `dart.analyzeAngularTemplates` setting has been fixed to correctly registers editor functionality for HTML files when the Angular analyzer plugin is enabled.

## Performance

- [#1840](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1840)/[#2003](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2003)/[#1961](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1961): Scanning for projects is now asynchronous which should improve extension activation speed and reduce the chances of triggering VS Code's "extension causes high CPU" warning.

## Flutter

- [#2004](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2004)/[#2005](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2005): The **Flutter: New Web Project** command has been removed. To create web projects, you should now use the standard **Flutter: New Project** command. Note: Web support is still in preview, see [the Flutter site](https://flutter.dev/web) for more info.
- [#1983](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1983)/[#1997](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1997): Running emulators will now show their friendly emulator name (as shown before launching) in place of their device names (for example "Pixel 2" instead of "Android SDK built for x86").
- [#1994](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1994): Performing a Hot Restart while the debugger is in a pause state will no longer get stuck in a paused state when the app is actually running.

## Testing

- [#1971](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1971): Trying to run a whole group of tests will no longer fail with "Unable to start test for node with no test or group name".

## Other

- [#2002](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2002): Changing the SDK version back to **Auto-Detect** using the SDK picker will once again clear the workspace-level setting and fall back to searching `PATH` for an SDK.
- [#1717](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1717): SDK and log paths in settings are now categorised as machine-specific which will prevent them applying in remote workspaces where the remote may have different paths (or be a different platform).
