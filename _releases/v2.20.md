# v2.20.0

## Preview: toString() Calls in Debug Views

It's now possible to force the debugger to call `toString()` on classes when displaying them in debug views (this includes the Variables pane, the Watch pane, tooltips and inline debug views) with the `dart.previewToStringInDebugViews` setting. This feature is experimental and may have a performance impact.

## Lint Names in Problems View

VS Code now natively shows lint names and error codes in the Problems view so the `dart.showLintNames` setting has been removed.

## Quick-Fix for Ignoring Lints/Hints

A new setting `dart.showIgnoreQuickFixes` (default: `false`) has been added that will add quick-fixes for ignoring lints and hints to the lightbulb menu.

These fixes will also show up in the Problems View.

## Don't Format Specific Files/Folders

Since VS Code does not allow per-folder/file settings, it's now possible to stop certain files/folders from being formatted with the `dart.doNotFormat` setting. The setting is an array of string globs that are checked against the full file path.

```js
"dart.doNotFormat": [
	"**/*.g.dart",
	"**/generated/**",
	"**/Google/flutter/**",
]
```

Note: Until [this VS Code issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/59953) is implemented, this will stop both format-on-save and explicit Format Document calls from formatting.

## Snippet Mode Fixes

The issue that caused completions of Flutter widget constructors to stick in "snippet mode" meaning further completions didn't work until you pressed `<escape>` has been fixed! You should no longer see this:

## Argument Placeholders in Imports/Exports

Completing function names on an `import`/`export` line will no longer try to insert argument placeholders as if you were calling the function.

## Other Improvements

- Flutter projects in immediate subfolders of the workspace folder are now detected and will force the editor into Flutter mode.
- Formatting of text in progress notifications shown when Flutter is downloading SDKs/packages has been improved. 
- Tooltips will no longer show dartdoc directives like `{@tool xxx}`.
- Code completion will no longer pop open when typing colons in case statements.
- Code completion will no longer pop open when typing spaces outside of argument lists.
- Code Lens links for running tests will no longer appear inside test files for projects that do not support being run with `pub run test` (for example the Dart SDK repository).
- The "Create File" refactor no longer displays an error when invoked.
- Setting the debugger to break on `All Exceptions` will no longer pause inside threads running framework snapshots (such as during `package:test` startup code).
- Debug sessions should no longer remain active until the Stop button is clicked when Dart script fails to compile.
- Terminating commands like `pub get` repeatedly should no longer result in orphaned progress notification messages.
- PubCache and AppData folders are now excluded from analysis should you open your entire user directory in VS Code.
- The prompt offering to run `pub get` when the `.packages` file is missing/out-of-date will no longer appear for Fuchsia projects.
- The `dart.runPubGetOnPubspecChanges` setting now defaults to `false` for Fuchsia projects.
- The path `topaz/tools/prebuilt-dart-sdk/${platform}` has been added to the top of Dart SDK search paths for Fuchsia projects.

Note: This version requires VS Code v1.28 (up from v1.27).
