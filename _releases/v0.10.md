# v0.10.0

- Debug support has been added! Breakpoints, hover evaluation, watch window, call stack etc. should all work (with some minor known issues)
- Rename (`F2`) now works for most items
- The update check for SDKs now connects to the internet to check for updates instead of using a hard-coded last-known-update value
- A new setting has been added to disable SDK update checks/notifications (`dart.checkForSdkUpdates`)
- Properties will now display better in completion/symbol lists and not as callable methods
- SDK paths that have been removed from settings will no longer continue to be searched at startup
- Indent settings for `pubspec.yaml` and `analysis_options.yaml` will now also be forced into 2-spaces at load (if `dart.setIndentation` has not been set to `false`)
