# v2.1.0

- [Flutter] A new command has been added to the command palette to run `flutter doctor`
- Dart and Flutter SDKs are now found in `PATH` even when they start with `~/` for a users home directory
- All path names in config (log files, analyzer path, SDK path) now support starting with `~/` for a users home directory
- When enabled, debug logging should now flush correctly before terminating to reduce the changes of data not being recorded
- A new setting has been introduced (`showLintNames`) which will prefix lint/hint names into messages in the `Problems` pane to make it easier to `// ignore` them if you wish
