# v2.12.0

## Support for Flutter Profile and Release Modes

You can now create launch configurations for `profile` and `release` modes in Flutter apps. For now, this requires you to create a `launch.json` and add the setting there..

For more information on using profile and release modes, see [Running Flutter Apps in Profile or Release Modes](/docs/running-flutter-apps-in-profile-or-release-modes/).

## Flutter Memory Usage Monitoring

When running a `profile` build (or if you set [`showMemoryUsage`](/docs/running-flutter-apps-in-profile-or-release-modes/) in your launch configuration) the total memory for your applications heaps will be shown in the status bar.

Note: This is heap usage and not total process memory. In debug builds it may not be reflective of actual usage in a release build.

## Progress Notifications for Long Running Tasks

Long running tasks like [`Flutter: Get Packages`](/docs/commands/#flutter-get-packages) and Flutter builds will now show more obvious progress notifications with progress animations.

As part of this, these actions may also now be cancelled from the `x` in the notification.

## Flutter Icons in Tooltips and Completion Descriptions

Flutter icons now show correctly in tooltips and completion descriptions instead of chunks of HTML.

## Extract Method Refactor

An `Extract Method` refactor is now available on the lightbulb menu when you have a code selected.

## Better Feedback for Failed Renames

Failed renames will now show errors directly in the editor instead of window-scoped notifications that require dismissing. In an upcoming VS Code release we will gain the ability to block the rename input box from appearing at a location that does not support a rename.
