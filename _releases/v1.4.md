# v1.4.2

**Note:** This version requires Visual Studio Code 1.13.

- Code completion will now show types for named arguments more reliably
- Argument placeholders will now (again) insert placeholder text instead of empty strings
- Completing methods that take no arguments will no longer place the cursor between the parens as if there are arguments to type
- When selecting items from the code completion list the cursor will now more reliably move to the expected location after insertion
- New snippets have been added for `test` and `group` methods defined in the `test` package
- Dart Code will now activate when opening workspaces that include a `pubspec.yaml` anywhere in the tree, not just in the workspace root folder
- Debug logging will no longer appear in the `Debug Output` window when launching a debug session
- Snippets now have *slightly* more verbose descriptions of their functionality


# v1.4.1

- Identifiers that start or end with `$` symbols will now highlight correctly
- Highlighting of variables inside interpolated strings is now more accurate
- Configuration snippets have been added to make adding additional debug configs to `launch.json` easier

# v1.4.0

- Code assists are now available and will show up as lightbulbs similar to existing code fixes (for example, `Wrap in new widget` in Flutter projects)
- Code completion will now refresh on certain key presses (`space`, `(`, `=`) which should result in more accurate results more often
- Code completion results are now sorted by relevance rather than alphabetically
- Cursor position should now be better maintained when executing code fixes
- `pubspec.yaml` and `analysisoptions.yaml` will once again use the built-in YAML language/highlighting
- When opening a flutter project, the `.packages` file will now also be used when trying to locate the Flutter SDK
- The error message shown when unable to locate the Flutter SDK has been simplified and a link to the Flutter download page added
- The environment variable `FLUTTER_HOME` is not recommended for use and will no longer be used to locate a Flutter SDK (`FLUTTER_ROOT` is still checked)
