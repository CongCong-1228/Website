sort_order: v0002_0007
excerpt: Debugging path improvements, better automatic completion triggering...
---

# v2.7.3

- Typing a `{` will no longer cause code completion to automatically appear unless it was immediately preceeded by a `$`

---

# v2.7.2

This version contains no functional changes but updates some internal references to the extension's publisher ID which has been changed from DanTup to Dart-Code.

---

# v2.7.1

- Further improvements have been made to reduce the chances of `print`ing JSON from Flutter apps from crashing the debugger
- If during a hot reload, code that has changed was not re-executed (for example if you change the `main` method) you will now see a notification with an option to perform a hot restart
- Long Dart SDK version numbers (git hashes) will now be truncated in the status bar (the full version is available in the tooltip)

---

# v2.7.0

- When debugging, call stacks on Windows should no longer show long (incorrect) relative paths
- Find references will no longer hang with `Loading...` if invoked somewhere that has no results (eg. keywords)
- Code completion will no longer hang with `Loading...` when using the Angular plugin and there are no results
- Code completion will now trigger automatically after typing `$` or `{` inside strings
- Saving `pubspac.yaml` in a Flutter project will no longer run `pub get` but instead run the Flutter eqvuilent
- Executing SDK commands will now pick a more appropriate workspace (or prompt for one if it cannot)
- Folders named `packages` that contain real projects (like inside the Flutter repo) will now be detected more accurately (reducing package path resolution issues)
- The Flutter debugger will no longer crash if you `print` a JSON array
- The Flutter debugger will no longer hang if you create breakpoinst prior to launching the debug session
- Vanilla Flutter projects inside the Fuchsia tree should now be treated like Flutter and not Fuchsia, enabling the Flutter deamon and debugging support
