- A warning will be shown if a launch config contains a variable that cannot be resolved
- The warning `Unknown kind: MIXIN` when writing code using mixins will no longer be printed to the dev console
- Opening a `.code-workspace` file that contains paths that do not exist will no longer cause the extension to fail to activate
- The `deviceId` field now shows in completion for launch configs and will not generate a warning when used
- The labels in the SDK picker have been moved around so that long paths are less likely to be truncated
- Code completion now shows file and folder icons
- It's now possible to create a launch config for `Run All Tests` by setting the `program` property to point at a test folder
- Dart's syntax highlighting will no stop font ligatures working if the Bracket Pair Colorizer 2 extension is installed
- The `Flutter: Save Screenshot` command now works when multiple devices are connected, using the device selected in the status bar for the screenshot
