# v2.8.2

- Code completion has been updated to use a new field provided by the analysis server that allows the text to be inserted to be different from the text displayed in the completion

# v2.8.1

Code 1.20.0 included a change that broke debugging for projects without a `launch.json`. A fix is on its way but in the meantime a workaround has been added to restore the ability to debug. As a consequence you will need to select the correct debug type *twice* when first debugging a project with no `launch.json` but this will be addressed in a future update (after Code's fixes are live).

# v2.8.0

- Code completion will automatically trigger when manually typing `import "` to help complete package/filenames
- Code completion will automatically trigger in the correct location when completing the `import "";` snippet to help complete package/filenames
- The document symbol list will no longer fail to load for documents returning `CONSTRUCTOR_INVOCATION` symbols in results
- Code completion will no longer fail to load for documents returning `CONSTRUCTOR_INVOCATION` symbols in results
- The debug adapter should no longer crash if you `print()` JSON that looks like a flutter command while debugging a flutter application (additional improvements over those already made in previous releases)
-  Debug status text like "Initializing hot reload" will no longer remain visible if you terminate a debugging session while it is visible
- The "Full restart recommended" hint has been moved from an information bar at the top of the window to the status bar
- Pressing the debuggers Restart button to perform a hot reload will no longer crash if you have unsaved changes
- Invoking Save All will no longer cause multiple hot reload requests which could result in crashes
- If a hot reload is requested while another is in progress, the message "Reload already in progress" will be displayed in the debug output and the request ignored
