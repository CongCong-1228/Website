# v0.9.0

- A warning will be shown at startup if your Dart SDK is older than the one the current Dart Code was tested with
- If you have multiple open Dart projects using different versions of the SDK, running a command line app (`F5`) will no longer use the SDK from the last Dart project opened
- Various improvements have been made to the display of search results and code-completion items
- Snippets have been added for common code (`main`, `try`, `switch`, `import`, `class`, `typedef` and more!)
- Errors will no longer occur trying to run `pub get` or `pub upgrade` if your SDK is in a path that contains spaces
