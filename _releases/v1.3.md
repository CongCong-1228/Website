- When opening a Flutter project, the below locations will be checked for a Flutter SDK and the embedded Dart SDK will be used (if no flutter SDK is found an error message will be shown)
  - `.\bin\flutter(.bat)`
  - `(FLUTTER_ROOT)\bin\flutter(.bat)`
  - All folders in `PATH`
- Dart SDK update checks are now disabled for Flutter projects due to the embedded Dartk SDK
- Pub commands are now generally replaced with Flutter equivilents when a Flutter project is open (note: Pub commands still appear in the command palette for familiarity but will execute flutters versions)
- When `flutter: sdk: flutter` is added to/removed from `pubspec.yaml` you will be prompted to reload to switch between Dart/Flutter SDKs
- Pub commands will no longer appear in the command palette when a Dart project is not open
