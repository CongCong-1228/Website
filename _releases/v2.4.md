# v2.4.4

- The search path for the Flutter SDK cached by Fuchsia has been updated in line with the latest Fuchsia code
- The `dart.userDefinedSdkPath` setting will now override the Dart SDK used for Fuchsia projects (this is temporary [until Fuchsia and Flutter get their own override](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/440))

---

# v2.4.3

**Note:** This version requires Visual Studio Code 1.17.

- The search path for the Dart SDK in Fuchsia projects has been updated to reflect the new location in a `third_party` folder
- Several debug APIs are being removed in Code 1.18 so Dart Code has been moved off them - these should have no visible effects but since there was a lot of refactoring there is risk of new bugs in:
  - Code that provides debug configurations for new projects that do not have a `.vscode/launch.json` file
  - Code that supplements the launch config with things like SDK paths before passing to the debug adapter
  - Code that passes custom commands (like Flutter's hot reload, toggle debug painting, etc.) from the IDE to the debug adapter

---

# v2.4.2

- The [`Closing Labels preview`](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/383) feature will no longer show a toast popup asking for feedback every time it activates

---

# v2.4.1

**Note:** This version requires Visual Studio Code 1.16.

- Tooltips for items with no dartdocs will now appear correctly (a breaking change in Code 1.16 resulted in these disappearing)
- The text colour for [`Closing Labels preview`](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/383) can now be controlled using the `dart.closingLabels` colour (you can set this in your settings, inside the `workbench.colorCustomizations` section - [see here](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/408#issuecomment-321996305))
- Go-to-Definition will no longer sometimes open some files inside your own project as read-only on Windows because of path casing differences
- TODOs will now appear with lower priority than lints and hints in the Problems pane
- The error message shown when the Flutter SDK cannot be find will now correctly refer to the `FLUTTER_ROOT` environment variable instead of `FLUTTER_HOME`

---

# v2.4.0

- Dart Code will now activate if a workspace contains a `.dart` file rather than only if it contains a `pubspec.yaml` file or when a `.dart` file is specifically opened
- The dependency tree should work more reliably for `.packages` files that are not consistent with those generated by `pub` (for example, the hand-maintaned one in the Dart SDK repo)
- Errors that occur when running Flutter debug commands will now be shown in the debug console
- The [`Closing Labels preview`](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/383) has been updated to use functionality provided by the Dart SDK which will result in better performance and improved labels (this requires SDK `v1.25.0-dev.11.0` or later)
