# v3.11.0 *2020-05-29*

## Preview: Update Imports on Rename

## TODO: SCREENSHOT

- [#548](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/548)/[#1740](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1740): Implement refactor: Move file.

## Global Expression Evaluation

## TODO: SCREENSHOT

- [#906](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/906)/[#1062](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/1062): Support global expression evaluation inc. while not paused.

## Improved CodeLens Templating

## TODO: SCREENSHOT

- [#2459](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2459)/[#2466](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2466): Support multiple templates on launch configs.
- [#2458](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2458): Allow scoping CodeLens links to folders.

## Commands

- [#2436](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2436)/[#2437](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2437): DevTools and other pub package updates are not detected if they only vary with build metadata (`+foo`) due to differences between Pub's versioning scheme and SemVer.
- [#2430](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2430)/[#2432](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2432): If DevTools fails to launch, a prompt will be shown to try re-activating it.
- [#2414](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2414)/[#2418](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2418): `pub` and `flutter` commands will no longer show `.bat` suffixes in the output window on Windows.

## Debugger

- [#2471](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2471): When starting a debug session, the VM Service URL is now printed to the Debug Console.
- [#2448](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2448): Conditional breakpoints with expressions that return numerics are never hit in web.
- [#2447](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2447): Don't log errors from requests during shutdown.
- [#2428](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2428)/[#2469](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2469): When setting breakpoints in locations that will not be hit (for example in the Dart SDK when `dart.debugSdkLibraries` is set to `false`) a warning will be shown offering to change debug settings.
- [#2424](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2424)/[#2467](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2467): It's now possible to attach to processes by reading their `--write-service-info` file. This allows running arbitrary commands to spawn Dart processes that Dart-Code does not support (as long as they can use `--write-service-info`) and attach to them in one step using a launch configuration and a `preLaunchTask`.
- [#2423](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2423): When using a new enough Dart SDK (v2.9.0 onwards) it's now possible to debug internal Dart libraries, such as `dart:http`.

## Editor

- [#2468](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2468): Code completion now shows full documentation instead of only a summary.
- [#2426](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2426): Flutter Icons are now shown in the gutter when running in LSP mode.
- [#2425](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2425): Flutter UI Guides are now shown in the editor (if enabled) when running in LSP mode.

## Flutter

- [#2453](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2453): For web apps, the Chrome device will now be picked over the Web-server device by default.

## Testing

- [#2417](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2417): The test tree now shows test durations of the last run alongside the name.

## Misc

- [#2422](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2422)/[#2427](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2427): More of the work to find project roots at startup is now async, reducing the chance of triggering "Extension causes high CPU" warnings from VS Code.
- [#2476](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2476)/[#2481](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/2481): `pub get` will no longer automatically run when saving a `pubspec.yaml` file in a Bazel workspace.
