TODO: Rewrite/format these...

- filterText for completion doesn't include args/parens so should filter better
- only consider files tests if they're in a root test/ folder or end with _test.dart
- add support for passing env variables
- support terminateRequest for more graceful shutdown
- detect working directory correctly when program is set to relative path and cwd not set
- VS Code version number added to log headers
- Arrays should be sorted numerically (not by text) in Variables/watch windows
- Added "Disable update checks" button to SDK update prompt
- Enable asserts by default for VM
- Stop duplicate notes in test tree when running a single file, then "Run all tests"
- Stop "Inspect Widget" on Windows from jumping into framework code
- Fix folder name displayed in output pane when running pub/flutter commands
- Stop test suite icons sometimes being blank
- Grey out older test runs to make the last run stand out
- Implement support for quick-fixes that create files (eg. "create file" on an import with a non-existent file)
- Make Dart snippets work with editor.tabCompletion
- Failed test files no longer leave a "loading..." node in the tree
